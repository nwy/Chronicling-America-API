# Using the loc.gov API with the Chronicling America Historic Newspapers Collection

## Chronicling America: Digital Collection of Historic American Newspapers
   
    [**Chronicling America**](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/) is a searchable and freely accessible digital collection of historic newspaper pages. It contains millions of newspaper pages from nearly every state and territory in the United States published through 1963. The website also provides access to information about historic newspapers and is produced by the National Digital Newspaper Program (NDNP).
 
    NDNP, a partnership between the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the Library of Congress, is a long-term effort to develop an Internet-based, searchable database of U.S. newspapers with descriptive information and select digitization of historic pages. Supported by NEH, this rich digital resource is developed and permanently maintained at the Library of Congress. An NEH award program will fund the contribution of content from, eventually, all U.S. states and territories.
